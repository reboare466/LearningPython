# Every if statement must have an else.
# If the else should never run then it needs a way to exit the block and an error message.
# Never nest if statements more than two deep.
# Treat if statements like paragraphs (sets of sentences) with space before and after.
# Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex move their calculations elsewhere with a variable.
