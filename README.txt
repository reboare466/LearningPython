In this repository you will find my scripts written while going through the online tutorial found here: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html

I already know many basics about Python but I go through the early exercises anyway because my skills could use some sharpening.

If you are looking for examples of how much I have learnt then check out the latest scripts or read the tutorial pages online.
